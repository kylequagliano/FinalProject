"The data set contains a mass of data mostly pertaining to peoples health, employment/income, Covid health/ job status because of covid and the region in the world they are located."

"Questions I want to answer with the dataset:
1. Did people who were not trying to look for employment in previous years, try harder to look for a job when covid hit?
2.Did people make a new attempt at improving themselves/ find jobs after the pandemic?
3.Does the family income of a person make them use less effort in trying to find a job?
4. Are older or younger people trying harder to find employment?
5. Are people with higher education more unemployed during the pandmeic?"

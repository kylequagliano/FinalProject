data <- read.csv('atus_00002.csv')
str(data)
summarize(data)


"The data set contains a mass of data mostly pertaining to peoples health, employment/income, Covid health/ job status because of covid and the region in the world they are located."

"Questions I want to answer with the dataset:
1. Did people who were not trying to look for employment in previous years, try harder to look for a job when covid hit?
2.Does the family income of a person make them use less effort in trying to find a job?
3. Are older or younger people trying harder to find employment?
4. Are people with higher education more unemployed during the pandmeic?"

employmentStatusBefore <- data %>% filter(YEAR< 2020) %>% filter(FWK_EMPLR <3)
employmentStatusAfter <- data %>% filter(YEAR >= 2020) %>% filter(FWK_EMPLR <3)
summary(employmentStatusBefore$FWK_EMPLR)
summary(employmentStatusAfter$FWK_EMPLR)
summary(employmentStatusBefore$FWK_NOTHING)
summary(employmentStatusAfter$FWK_NOTHING)
"By looking at the summaries of the average value of people that looked for jobs there is no clear evidence that people tried harder to find a job when covid hit given that the average is slightly larger when covid hit it is not large enough to provide conclusive evidence that it did."
familyIncome <- data.frame(data$FAMINCOME, data$FWK_EMPLR)
summary(familyIncome)
familyIncome <- familyIncome %>% filter(data.FAMINCOME > 13) %>% filter(data.FAMINCOME < 17) %>% filter(data.FWK_EMPLR < 2)
boxplot(data.FAMINCOME~data.FWK_EMPLR, data=familyIncome, xlab="Looking for Work", ylab="Family Income", main="Family Income and looking for work")
"By looking at the graph for family income and looking for work there is no noticeable correlation between the family income and their effort in trying to find a job."

age <- data.frame(data$AGE, data$FWK_EMPLR)
age <- age %>% filter(data.FWK_EMPLR <2)
boxplot(data.AGE~data.FWK_EMPLR, data=age, xlab="Looking for Work", ylab="Age", main="Age and looking for employment")
"From the boxplot it appears that older people are trying harder to find a job with the average is 35 years old."


lowerEducation <- data %>% filter(EDUC < 40) %>% filter(YEAR==2020)
higherEducation <- data %>% filter(EDUC >= 40) %>% filter(YEAR==2020)
higherEducation %>% ggplot(aes(y=EMPSTAT)) + geom_bar()
lowerEducation %>% ggplot(aes(y=EMPSTAT)) + geom_bar()
"By looking at both of the bar charts it is evident that people with higher education were employed more during COVID-19 with them having the same amount of people being employed as people with lower education, but there are less people in total that have higher education showing a strong correlation that people with higher education were more employed. "

"In conclusion there was not a lot of correlation found between a better effort put towards oneself before and after the pandemic."
